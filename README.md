**Object Detection**
Object Detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and locates multiple objects within an image or video. This project leverages deep learning to build a real-time object detection system capable of detecting everyday objects like people, vehicles, bags, etc., using a pre-trained model.

It combines classification (what is the object?) and localization (where is the object?) to provide bounding boxes and labels on the input media.

🎯 Key Objectives
🔍 Detect and classify objects in images or live webcam/video feeds

📦 Draw bounding boxes around identified objects

⚙️ Use pre-trained models (YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) for fast and accurate results

🎥 Enable real-time detection on local webcam or uploaded videos
